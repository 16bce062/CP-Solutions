 Greedy algorithms work on problems for which it is true that, at every step, there is a choice that is optimal for the problem up to that step, 
 and after the last step, the algorithm produces the optimal solution of the complete problem.

To make a greedy algorithm, identify an optimal substructure or subproblem in the problem.
Then, determine what the solution will include (for example, the largest sum, the shortest path, etc.).
Create some sort of iterative way to go through all of the subproblems and build a solution.
